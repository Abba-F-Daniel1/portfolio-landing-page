      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Daniel Abba Frederick, a first-class graduate of
        Electrical/Electronics Technology from the prestigious Abubakar Tafawa
        Balewa University, Bauchi, Nigeria. As an aspiring Software Engineer
        with a keen interest in web and mobile application development, I am
        currently honing my skills at ALX. My journey into the world of software
        engineering was inspired by a simple yet profound realization. During my
        time at university, I noticed how challenging it was for event
        organizers to manage registrations effectively. Whether it was a
        seminar, a workshop, or a cultural fest, the process was often
        disorganized and inefficient. As an attendee, I experienced first-hand
        the confusion and frustration that resulted from this lack of a
        streamlined process. This experience sparked a question in my mind:
        ‘Could there be a better way?’ With my growing interest in software
        engineering, I realized that I had the tools to answer this question.
        This led to the birth of EventVertex, an online event registration
        platform designed to make event management a breeze. EventVertex is more
        than just a project; it’s a solution born out of personal experience and
        the desire to make a difference. It represents my journey as a software
        engineer, constantly learning, innovating, and striving to create
        real-world solutions. As I continue my journey in the tech world, I am
        excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I am committed
        to using my skills to create solutions that make a difference, one line
        of code at a time.
